did you know
it is mentioned in bible hagara mother of ishmael wife of abraham she was left in deser of paran mekka
in the midle of desert paran god caused a spring to burst forth from the ground where ishmael's heel lay zamzam
hagar was abrahams wife he had a son ishmael with her arabs are from him i mentioned connection with kaaba
bible is not credible source for facts because it is mixture between true and fals original bible is on aramaic lng
i am trying to tell you the fact about connection between ishmael end abrahams building the kaaba in desert paran
you are acusing prophet abraham that he was a sinner because he had two wifes
same as for solomonhe had wifes according to bible
it is all god decision ptophets didnt act by their own they were submitted to god orders
if poligamy was forbidden as you said why abraham than accept hagar as a wife
hahaha what a nonsense characteristic of jews is accusing and lying for god prophets because of that are cursed
abraham wasn't hebrew hebrews are from isaac precisely from david arabs are from ishmael
i am not denying fact that sarah was abrahams wife hagar was his wife too he with his son ishmael built kaaba
jews hebrew are denying the fact that isus was a mesiah they call him bastard and his mother mary immoral
same as you are calling ishmael bastard and for you abraham was immoral and sinner neudhubillah they are free from
hahaha that is proof for you you didn't prove anything lier repent and accept islam only authentic monoteism
where is the proof that he was a hebrew or maybe for you noah was a hebrew or even adam hahahahaha
hahahahahah you are totally full of nonsense and foolish hahahahahah you make me laugh with this

of course when you're not united your leaders can't use all the means available in the most efficient and coherent way
as long as the situation keeps this way with disunion or union upon something else than kufr bi-taghut it will keep getting worse
i just tweet rum diaries nothing else my dear hearted follower
today nublzahra who knows what's next maybe tomorrow aleppo's lost then jisr and groups keep begging al salul amp erdogan
syrian opposition activists start a hashtag campaign meaning they have all betrayed us
not trying to show anything trying to show a united body is harder to break than a heterogeneous body made of clay
allah swt wouldn't have linked disunity with loss of power if it wasn't true it's a sunna of life always true
distance to lift siege on kweirs amp nublzahra was approximately the same
first needed days the other hours
bill killcoconutuncle to defend the american freedom and also the freedom of coconut cat lover or hater kebab fan we're all living in america
zero
you're wasting your time my point is disunity brings defeat fullstop
they learned their lesson that's why they retreat when an area isn't important hasakah area among others amp come back later
alnusra militant injured in battles against
officials more than iranian soldiers killed in aleppo battles in hours real number may be higher

wouldn't have done better in n-aleppo if they weren't under a single imam i hope not

the dar al-islam quran competition organized by diwan of da'wah amp masajid in
may allah blessing the khilafah for organizing this good events which making the citizens a hafidh of al-quran
in this day we can clearly see and understand why shadnani said we will crush the groups
i can't find words to describe what the sahawat did today in marea this is beyond treachery
signing an agreement with pkk to give away mare to the atheists who will not apply any sharia forbid salat and close mosques yes
sign an agreement to let is take control of mare' instead of the pkk hell no
rebel scum in n-aleppo instead of letting is take mare they preferred giving it to the pkk
can you understand now why is calls them sahawat
if those aren't sahawat what are they
are those the kind of people aq wants to ally with to bring a just islamic state in syria may allah deal with you
yes is was right they are sahawat who don't give a cent about sharia or bringing a khilafah or implementing islam or any of the like
anyone with a mustard's grain worth of faith in his heart would prefer a million times hand over mare'
to is who implements sharia and rules with islam instead of giving it to the pkk
they wanted to revolt against bashar and they ended up being slaves to the tawaghit and their puppet agents well done
they didn't bring safety they didn't implement sharia they didn't spread justice they didn't implement hudud they didn't liberate
they didn't keep any land they liberated they didn't unify with each other they didn't rock the nusayris they didn't lift
any siege on anything
you couldn't find one single one of them ready to sacrifice himself for the sake of allah to defend mare'
worthless apostate rats calling themselves mujahideen
anding over mare' to the islamic state no but handing it over to the pkk yes
a so-called state an organization with limited resources fighting the whole world for years didn't give away any city except
with fierce resistance and dozens of fighters sacrificing themselves and here you have factions with support
from big arab countries who couldn't fight for days
o rebels if you gave mare' to is reinforcements would have come to it all the way from the outskirts of baghdad and mosul
but now that you have given it to the pkk they even took your weapons nobody will take it back for you
words of thought from our brother maghrebi follow him on telegram

hafnium fulaanifidaee friendly brother from mars observing the world since th account street

have dawlah warned to seek help from kuffar and tawagheet which it only led you to the path of humiliation
just look what so-called geneva peace talks led you now only to be use as launchpad to anhilate you
hoping that so-called islamic coalition and global coalition to finish khilafah
by allah he will not forsake them
this is the promise of allah and he will always helping those who strive to make his words utmost
despite tawagheet attempt to paint khilafah as despicable and not-islam day by day it's shown to us that they are indeed islamic
i don't understand how anyone can be expecting help from erdogan wen he can't even retaliate against pkk without permission f

the proposed ceasefire in a nutshell
yes but syrian rebels are stupid and not known to have the ability to see in the long-term and with strategy
neither do they have the ability to see that they are being used which is why the us used them like a used condom
calls for parliament elections in th of april
the sad history of muslims get used by foreign powers and then get ditched like how ahrar got ditched by us
al-jazeera reporter faisal qasim asks the public if they supports isis' bombings in homs and damascus said yes
isis in last days
- shaddadi attack repelled
- killed hundreds of shias in damascus and homs
- assad route to aleppo in khanasir cut off
not true rebels put themselves into this position by hinging their fate on the us's dictats then got betrayed
you're right the majority won't thats why fsa don't represent the majority they only represent petty interests
trump we should kill muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood video -
look at the arrows near the bottom isis have cut off assads supply lines to aleppo and weakened the seige
i suspect the fsa will repay isis' favour by signing a ceasefire with assad and join forces with him against isis
supposedly isis although its a fluid situation kurds lost hundreds of men due to their incompetance without us airstrikes
it only makes sense because rebels have finally realised that if they don't unite us ypg assad and russia will eat them up
dear mark go back to bed it is now in not
these tweets summarise the limitations of the ypg and its inability to extend military control over parts of syria
the islamic state and jund al-aqsa are co-ordinating with each other to cut off assad's supply lines to aleppo
recent arab history always involved collaborating with non-muslim foreigners against muslims treachery endemic to their culture
the pathetic beggers from the fsa try to prove their worth to the us by attacking isis even after us betrayed them
century's most despicable amp brazen statement after the apology of committing war crimes in by
the question is can you handle real journalism
us bombs maternity hospital in
conflict reporterwarreporter to show how petty arab media is
this is the kind of corrupt tinpot dictatorship that the us calls its ally no wonder ordinary muslims hate us
from a terror group to another terror group
from occupation to another occupation
these battles indicate that the islamic state has the capacity to take territory from ypg whenever it feels like
it needs to be understood that the ypg takeover of isis territory is a long-term strategic feint by isis untill the right time

they killed all the mujahidin from uzbek amp didn't stop there they killed their children amp women too

about this - - can you arabic the news said killed after their failed attack
what is your definition of nationalist
even usa admits taliban are nationalists that they removed them
from their terrorist list because they know the taliban will never operate outside afghanistan

and this is what you call humint human intelligence this type of information helps us special forces plan raids
for example they need to know how many guards guard a building before they raid it and rescue a hostage etc
a future possible way that isis will use to avoid these spies is to apply aqidah tests more thoroughly
yes his subsequent interviews in the media gave people an impressive image of isis he was like i never saw anyone like them
million iraq's died during the 's un oil-for-food program and millions more died during afghan and iraq wars
the taliban lied again and claimed this isis commander defected from isis he actually died in a us drone strike
actually they said he defected to the afghanistan army but taliban exploited the lie to propagate against is
i seems nusra's supporters have little ethics here they make a false oath that isis women are whores
the taliban don't seem to realise that their reputation for lies and dirty tricks is pushing people towards isis
the istishhadi may allah accept him
lets not forget this man inappropriately named sayf aladhil just made takfir on isis supporters saying baghdadi is their god

where are those people who were worried for palmyra or perhaps you are not interested now
released new propaganda video about wants to recruit new fighter in lebanon for an lebanon invasion
another fsa group stops fighting assad and joins the anti-isis sdf having been promised power in a post-isis syria
chechen fighters in syria seeing that the banner of worldwide jihad belongs to isis and not al-qaedanusra
i think the point of ypgrussian attacks was to get the fsa to realise if you can't beat them coalition then join them
now fsa are realising that they are safer if they do what russiausypg say and agree to peace with assad and fight isis
final adnani amp abu waheeb when were reportedly killed or rumored seen where amp by whom
nice groups gathered jund al haramain army of two holy mosques - mekka amp medina and ypg atheist comunist and fsa democrats
is us allowing russia to attack fsa in order to force fsa to make peace with assad and fight isis the new us ground force
army artillery is shelling positions in north now
same happened when uk promised arabs their own land under the mcmahon correspondence but uk made secret agreement
with zionists under the balfour declaration to give the land arabs took from ottomans to jews arabs being duped again
britain made arabs fight ottomans then betrayed arabs by giving the liberated land to zionists to create israel
pt we're seeing the same in syria with false us promises to fsa who will find themselves being betrayed just like their forefathers
it's a classic case of betrayal the arabs did all the legwork then found their efforts wasted see
the main beneficiary will be assad who is needed to ensure a terrorist-free syria this is us' way of covertly helping him

i think you are right
media personal information of of attacks attackers were found in the recent 'leaked documents'

of course that is not to say that the ottomans were angels according to jihadists they were mushriks anyway see

the turkish backed jihadists or nusra right
i dont believe us has control over regimerussia but definitely have influence to stop their rapid gains they made against fsa
by forcing this ceasefire on them soon after the ceasefire started usas dogs started operating in north aleppo
yes that it was all about basically converting the fsa into a ground force against isis while leaving assad alone
she killed them little terrorist babies
if they want usa to protect from putin and ypg then the price is going to be fighting isis

video of huge destruction in civilian homes of
initially it is quite difficult to use as it works in a totally different but secure way to windows best to get used to it
comparison btw and it doubles as a v useful intro
in qubes os if browser gets infected with a virus your operating system does not it uses virtual machines for everything
west witnessed largest vbieds attacks today reports of mass causalities among army and shiite milit
yes it's open-source it is kind of linux-based it uses a bare-metal hypervisor virtual machine and a linux gui and
every process runs in a vm and is isolated from one another so if an application gets compromised nothing else does
its the way to go for future operating systems ie isolation through containersvirtual machines worth studying their site
today most operating systems are monolithic meaning if one thing gets a virus everything else on the system is vulnerable
about gigabytes its tricky to install but work on it once it is installed it should be useful for sensitive use
by helping kurdishshia militias us is permanently driving a wedge between it and sunni arabs only isis benefits
its best to install it standalone like in a dual-boot setup the makers don't recommend it in a virtual machine
because if your host os is compromised so is your installation of a qubes os vm vm's are never good for secure os use
why it's a bad idea to run a secure os like tails os kali in a virtual machine if host is compromised so is vm
i think it has an option to install it as a xfe i installed it yesterday has a few different shell options
but to be honest when it comes to protecting yourself we can't be fussy about which shell it's using
you can try joining their mailing list and asking questions or read their qubes os architecture page im sure there is a reason
here is a guy installing qubes os release candidate

putin orders russian pigs to withdraw from shaam
words spread that putin the khanzeer orders the withdrawal of russki from shami frontlines
let's see how serious he is
breaking putin orders start of withdrawal of main part of russian military force in syria from tuesday
in the next stage of war in syria the syrian rebels will make peace with assad and go to war with isis and nusra
the ceasefire in syria exposed nusra's weakness ie they were always seen as fighting mercenaries not governors
this is because nusra failed to manage expectations it gave the impression that it was a partner in the revolution
and not a group intending to establish a caliphate state so when nusra tried to govern with islam its partners objected
this is the problem when you hide your real views and adopt softly approach people object when you show your true colors

in a rare denial statement denies claim of killing shishani
the news agency denies the pentagon claim that is commander umar shishani was killed and also confirms that he was not injured
probably the first ever official statement denying death of a very high ranking commander they didn't even issue one for baghdadi
the us lied about killing umar shishani as it wanted to track metadata and chatter
what this basically means is that by analysing call spikes in certain areas they can guess where shishani really was
as it is assumed that the largest volume of calls would originate in the areas where shishani was really located

the islamic state severely punishes those who systematically and routinely perform chain takfir upon muslims
is does not declare takfir of any person unless he commits one of ten nullifiers of islam that are unanimously agreed upon by scholars
a the islamic state rejects the manhaj of al-irjaa and believes that the deed is a condition for validity
b and it is not a condition for faith perfection as the contemporary murji'a promote
a the islamic state does not make takfir on mainstream muslims or the masses and strictly hold accountable
b any person accusing them of being disbelievers in origin
the islamic state does not force people to join the state and does not make takfir on those who do not join it
a the islamic state does not declare takfir neither on those who disagree with it nor those who revile it
b or any for just fighting them except those who commit a clear nullifier of al-islam
the islamic state does not declare takfir upon any person via conjecture and unreliability unless with certainty and clear-cut evidences
is considers destroying and removing all signs of idolism and forbidding its means compulsory such as graves trees or pebbles
see my tl akhi
i put it today and see my telegram latest post
the manhaj methodology and aqida creed of the islamic state is the manhaj of ahlu al-sunnah wal-jama
the islamic state wages al-jihad to protect ahlu al-sunnah wal-jama and their honour
the islamic state believes that all twelver shia both ordinary person and scholars are disbelievers
the islamic state does not declare takfir on those who reject to make takfir upon mainstream rafida
upp
a the islamic state believes that those who reject to make takfir upon any of rafida scholar are disbelievers
b because all ulama are unanimously agreed on this point
the islamic state declares takfir on all parties based on communism secularism and liberalism
the islamic state declares takfir on proponents of secular democracy and those who promote it
a the islamic state declares takfir on all governments that do not rule by al-shari and
b permit what allah has forbidden such as usury alcohol and prostitution
the islamic state declares takfir on members of the taghout tyrant military and their police officers intelligence and ministers
upp
a the islamic state considers magician as a disbeliever and apostate and that killing him is compulsory
b and his repentance is not accepted in al-dunya after his apprehension
a the islamic state does not accuse a muslim because of his sins such as adultery
b drinking wine and stealing as long as he does not claim it is permitted for him to be doing so
a the islamic state believes that there are two types of kufr infidelity namely kufr asghar the minor disbelief and kufr akbar
b the major disbelief and judging who commit it is based on believing saying or acting
a the islamic state does not declare takfir upon a particular person or saying that he will stay in hellfire for ever
b this can be established only after proving al-kufr conditions and the inability to prove else
a the islamic state believes that it is compulsive to seek allah judgment in disputes as for
b the resorting to man-made laws negates one islam and leads to infidelity
a the islamic state believes in humbling ourselves before the prophet and whoever insults the prophet
b al-sahaba or any member of his household becomes a kafir and an apostate for it
a the islamic state believes that ba party is a clear disbelief and the apostasy of all those who affiliate with such groups
b and despite the differences in nationalism patriotism and secularism flagsit is a clear disbelief
the islamic state considers everyone who participated in political process ie al-nujayfi salim al-jubouri and others as apostates
a the islamic state considers the leaders of the islamic party muslim brotherhood as disbelievers and apostates
b and there is no difference between a participant in the government and a branch of the islamic party leader

a the islamic state considers al-jihad for the sake of allah as fard ayn compulsory on everyone
b and not fard kifaya since the fall of andalusia to free muslims
a the islamic state considers al-jihad with every good or bad doer since the largest sin after disbelieving in
b allah is the prohibition of al-jihad for the sake of allah when it is compulsory
is does not declare takfir upon the muslims who are living in dar al-kufr even if those countries were ruled by man-made laws
a the islamic state considers people of the scripture and sabians in the state of islam today as war people no honour for them
b because they had broken their oath in different ways so if they want to be safe and secure then they have to renew
c their oath with the state of islam according to omar ibn al-khattab treaty that they have refused
a the islamic state considers the members of other jihadi groups as its brothers and does not accuse them in disbelief or immorality
b but they are disobedient because they did not do the today duty which is unite under one banner
do you know arabic
a the islamic state considers respecting truthful ulama who do what they say compulsory
b and also to expose those who follow idol or compromise with it on anything in allah religion

i had shorter version akhi
if you read earlier unless the went against one of the nullifiers of islam
russian president vladimir putin confirms that the islamic state killed russian soldiers during near palmyra
didnt understand what you meant
a the islamic state issues a stern warning against use of third nullifier of al-islam according to one's own views and firmly
b adhere to follow the restricted and specific interpretations of the truthful ulama for the third nullifier and rushing to

russian military advisor killed in homs by isis
as part of the ceasefire deal with assad fsa rebels ignore assad and attack isis on the orders of us and turkey
prior to baghdad was a sunni-majority city until genocide was committed on them by shia militias
shi'ites are united while iran trains shia militias to defend assad saudi arabia enters syria to fight sunnis
so by rejecting making tekfir upon mainstream rafida who say ya ali person remain 'muslim' but upon scholar is kafir
le ypgsdfnsa ne sont pas consid comme des pro-occidentaux d'ailleurs le sdf attaque aussi les rebelles au nord
people assume saudi defends the interests of the sunnis it doesn't it only defends the interests of its royal family
le savoir fran en mati de s failli faire capoter la r tunisienne
in the early 's the saudi kings sponsored the creation of a new salafi sect which was pro-us and pro-saudi
has sent clear message to yesterday who claimed is now ready to take out
this government-sponsored salafi sect is so effective the us want to use it to delegitimise jihadists
this is from a us counter-terror report called stealing al-qa playbook
this point is batil there is no diference between mainstream rafidi and their scholars exept in fierceness of kufr
after the death of elite-hezbollah-fighters the assad-offensive against palmyra has stopped for the moment front
it's the same to say for that rejecting tekfir upon mainstream proponents of secular democracy isnt kufr only for leaders

the life of this duniya is only the enjoyment of deception qur'an
the hereafter is better and lasting
every soul shall taste death

the islamic state does not excuse someone due to ignorance regarding shirk al-akbar
the islamic state see the manhaj of al-hazimi as extreme and batil because ghulu in takfir leads to takfir of jama'at almuslimeen
yes it is akhi i copied it direct for the document distributed to us to avoid getting the original one justpaste removed
if i summarize the manhaj of the isthey warn you from misinterpreting the rd nullifies of islam and urges to carefully study it
misinterpretation leads to ghulu in takfirwithout any knowledgeand this is the manhaj of hazmiyah that leads to
getting dragged and ending at islamic court

why don't they excuse person who reject to make tekfir upon mainstream secular dekocrat rawafid are in bigger kufr and shirk
four points from surat al-kahf
shaikh al hazimi has correct aqeeda that what you call ghulu in tekfir is aqeedah of ahl sunnah
how can you excuse person for rejecting to make tekfir of rwafid ahl shirk and saying is don't make excuse in shirk akbar
and i doubt that this is official statement of islamic state regardin this issue can you bring us evidence
it begun after the so called is criticism that his students and son told was fabricated and counted release the original

i am talking about shirk and kufr akbar not for mesail-khafijjeh or kufr asgar or kufr where it is excuse etc
i actually wrote that that shirk is not excused due to ignorance in shirk akbar
alshabab collaborated with the appostate government of puntland state in somalia to attack the islamic state mujahideen
so their goal was to go and attack the islamic state mujahideen there
so they struck a deal with the puntland murtadeen to open the way for them so that they go and attack the mujahideen ther
they went there ie mudug amp nugaal from southern somalia with boats so somehow the western kuffar gvts got the word
the western kuffar then rebuked the puntland murtadeen for working with a terrorist organization - shabab and ordered th

alqaidah would do anything for power subhnallah

but we dont make takfir on muslim without even clarifying things to them
how can someone be a muslim if he consider his brother in faith a person who worship someone else beside allah

and i'm telling you from a muslim's perspective who has spent time reading their theology they are not a cult
it's always funny to receive lessons from non-muslims on islamic theology you would have branded wahhabism as a cult as well
while if you look closely at the wahhabi literature you find only the most authentic texts of islam that was an example
it's not about bringing anything the dabiq events are authentic islamic sources no muslim would argue on that
naming their magazine dabiq is more about symbolism not force events into happening

sacrificing one's life for allah is all over quran and if you're drawing conclusions from one told me well i'm not surprised
i know you have and i suggest you go right to the point over what you believe i am
there is only one brand of islam again sacrifice is in the quran amp part of authentic islam - with evidence
i hope you don't expect me to be convinced with published polls where answering i support is gets you right to jail
anyone not fitting in the western pov regarding islam radicalism extremism amp militancy is viewed as a terrorism supporter
it is your narrow point of view that draws you to such conclusions you need to take a step back and consider the general picture
that's your interpretation of what i said i'm telling you there are no purely objective statistics on the question
worse than that existing studies are actually deeply subjective and force a non-natural conclusion
check the quran amp sunna anything you find there regarding those issues is my opinion
imagine you would have asked me that same question in what conclusion would you have drawn there was no isis
still the quran amp sunna i'm referring to are still the same as in the prophet pbuh time
putting aside the neocolonialist notion of modern civilization what if the question was asked in the th century
you support the almoravid rebels who want to establish a death cult dynasty nonsense your problem isn't isis it's islam
what you don't seem to understand is that the notion of what constitutes archaism is subjective
footage from inside amp ancient sites surrounding the city no saa
what about the incredible arrogance you show by even suggesting that muslims should accept your modern civilized version of islam
i didn't know this word so i get dictionnary and then i found the real meaning lol
you don't need to be falcon-eyed to see who's trying to force his vision of the world on the other in the middle east
nothing of that would have happened if your f had stayed safe in their bases instead of tearing people apart in airstrikes

maghrebimaghrebihda moroccan engineer in nanotechnology commenting on middle east politics
the assad regime isn't sending all its capabilities for nothing the iranian rev guards aren't being sent for the sake of palmyra's ruins
afghan militias amp hezbollat aren't leaving all their fronts just for the symbolism of palmyra
nor is russia sacrificing its valuable special forces officers on the palmyra front just so the ruins can be brought back under assad
importance is strategic key to oil amp gas fields road to qaryatayn amp deir ezzor supply road to iraq access to eastern borders
the enemy is trying while the truce is active to rebuild the assad regime by asserting its control of the center of the country
the attack on the khanaserathriya road by is was also part of foiling the assadist plan to get back to tabqa
those two regime offensives khanaserathrya towards tabqa and palmyra are linked in a global strategy
meanwhile rebels are defending islam from the khawarij and signing a truce with the regime may the curse of allah be upon the unjust
what i love most about ahrar is the difference between their tweets and their actions
true that
us-coalition air force is also helping assad against islamic state in
notice also the airstrikes near marea helping their slaves the sahawat of n-aleppo
us coalition with ksa amp jordan participation strikes is near palmyra in clear support for the assad regime

isis sources saying isis have invaded dumayr a city north-east of damascus they are requesting prayers in support
ahrar motherfuckers watched slaughtering children for months fuck you amp fuck this revolution
isis have adopted the hit and run tactics throughout syria to weaken the enemy and cause attrition these tactics are
similar to the mobile guard used by the muslim general khalid ibn walid to cause enemy attrition
isis take their battle tactics from the conquests of syria and iraq by the rashidun caliphate they see that as best example
ahrar watched fro months bombed by zahran protected assad in damascus what kind of dogs this revolution brought

it's allowed for kuffar to bomb muslims just like in northern allepo
stop crying
hypocrite
an al-qaeda al-nusra commander interviewed on aljazeera says us airstrikes aided them to take al-rai from isis
this has something to do with an alleged internal coup which took place within nusra a few days ago it's alleged that
hardline pro-aq elements in nusra were killed in a us airstrike and moderate elements in nusra want to merge with rebels
recent rumours say nusras leader jawlani was killed and that abu mariya qahtani a moderate now defacto leads the group
al qa'ida bosses now ready to talk with the us
qatar again pushing it's proxies interests
allaahu akbar
beautiful words
it was obvious since last year that there was a moderate faction in nusra who wanted to leave aq to gain favor with the west
abu firas al-suri was one of those hardliners who stood in the way of the moderates who wanted to leave al-qaeda seems his
notice the trend
qatar - aljazeera - taliban - alqaeda -
as sheikh al adnani ha said sahwat al sham will end up in a national unity government with assad to fight the caliphat
conflict reporterwarreporter on conflicts in the mena and asia regions not affiliated to any group or movementworldwide contributions death was too convenient to be a coincidence and now rumours say jawlani is dead too i think moderate faction is doing this
jazrawi they said islamic state are uneducated stupid unwilling to cooperate
alqaeda fan boys
war is deception
we can ally with us to deceive everyone
and then buy weapons get strong then fight then
saudi tried that
fsa apostates gains along the border are like mold in the bathroom it's bad but it can be cleaned later inshallah
jazrawi true
only rumours saying he died in an airstrike on a building near idlib won't be surprised if his allies sold him out in return
alqaeda logic
fighting under us makes you a mujahid
fighting solely for allah independently makes you khawarij
for the power being offered to rebels during the peace process nusra should have known that their allies are unreliable
okay there is no need to mention alqaeda separately from sahawat alridda anymore
so please use sahawat alridda for alqaeda often
i think isis warned nusra that nusra should not to be allies with the rebels due to their corrupt ideology manhaj
al qa'ida v fanboys
apostates fighting under us air cover are mujahedeen
shubanallah
joulani wish is for us to take alqaeda off terror list

i advice you to fear allah as well these are true facts these naleppo factions are part of the us coalition vso program
negative assumption those factions are saying by themselves they're working with the us and it's assumptions
this well 'vettedinspected' vso mercenary main task is to guard borders in jarabulus-azaz strip only
so the sahawat of iraq were a response to khawarij tactics madness
we do know but you will keep pushing the 'good assumption' to infinity some of them even said so in statements
we know today they are part of the vso program encompassing all the factions participating in the n-aleppo
campaign hiwar kilis operation room with turkish artillery support amp coordination with us airstrikes fact
worse than that they're taking those villages where sharia ruled and are replacing it with other than sharia

wayf of maghreb and mashreqmiddle of nowhere point with hazimis is they never accept the fact there can be disagreement on someone kufrshirk
don't agree with them but can say among them are 'moderate' and very 'extreme' ones for example some say that basis of any
man is kufr until his kufr in taghut is proven with evidence and some say that if you don't make takfir on th in the chain
line you have not disbelieved in taghut
the reason many 'support' them is because they cover behind such terms as tawheed kufr bi taghut etc
is soldier's re write on the place where sahw removed it
see context i've talked about very 'extreme' ones

no its not lies you didn't prove that i'm a liar but did you watch the video
alhamdulillah we already have khillafah let us expand it be-idhinallah
sure but i hope you watch the video
then you decide which group are you if you are with kuffars prepare yourself with wanauthubillahi
if you wonder in the video at first hazimi says that one can follow the words of those who give udhr in big shirk and that
this issue is not the issue of islam and disbelief and that there is disagreement but later says that the one
who gives big udhr or says there is disagreement is further away from islam than christians jews and polytheists
this suggests that hazimi made kufr when he said the first words
looking forward just to get that one daysubhanallah may allah make easy for all of us we get that one day ameen

either way it suggests that ayman zawahiri will no longer be seen as relevant by jihadists who will see him as out of touch and soft
